EC504 Project: Space efficient VEB trees and their applications


This repository consists of four files at this current stage:

eVEB.h is a class definition of our space efficient VEB data structures, including the member function prototypes.
eVEB.cpp is an extension of the class definition, which includes all the member functions
test.txt is a sample text which is used as our test for Insertion, Successor and Deletion. (This is the one given to us for HW2 when coding the proto-VEB data structures and memember functions)
test.cpp is a test code.


In order to run these, download the .zip file of this repository, open it and then navigate to the EC504-Project folder using the terminal. Once in that directory, compile the code by typing "g++ test.cpp eVEB.cpp", assuming you have the corresponging C++ compiler. Compare the test.txt with the results displayed by the output in the terminal.


Test.txt is in the format: "%c %d" (%c means character, %d means integer)


%c: 
I for Insert
S for Successor
D for Delete

%d: any Integer
